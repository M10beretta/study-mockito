# Mockito

A simple example of testing using mockito.

An example of bad architecture practices is also shown _src/main/java/bad_practice_, <br>
and the challenges that come with it _src/test/java/bad_practice/TaxCalculatorTest.java_.<br>
The main difficulty is that it is hard and sometimes impossible to make __mock__ or __spy__ to test the class functionality.
